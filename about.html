    <p>
        This website was created to show a few characters from different 
        anime. This site showcases different fictional characters and 
        has information in a organized and easy to read way.
    </p>

    <p>
        I chose an anime theme because I enjoy anime and I knew there was a lot of
        characters I could choose from. For this assignment, I wanted it to be easy
        to use and look nice. I choose blue since its a lot of people like that color.
        This layout seemed to me to be the most organized looking one so I chose it.
